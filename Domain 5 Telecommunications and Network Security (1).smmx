This layer controls synchronization, data rates, line noise, and transmission techniques. Specifications for the physical layer include the timing of voltage changes, voltage levels, and the physical connectors for electrical, optical, and mechanical transmission.

Network interface cards and drivers convert bits into electrical signals and control the physical aspects of data transmission, including optical, electrical, and mechanical requirements. The following are some of the standard interfaces at this layer:

The data link layer is responsible for proper communication within the network components and for changing the data into the necessary format (electrical voltage) for the physical layer. It will also manage to reorder frames that are received out of sequence, and notify upper-layer protocols when there are transmission error conditions.

Some protocols that work at this layer include the following:
Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP)
Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)
Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP)
Ethernet
Token Ring
FDDI
ATM

When the data link layer applies the last header and trailer to the data message, this is referred to as framing. The unit of data is now called a frame.</note></topic><topic id="7" parent="6" x="1173.57" y="477.79" text="Logical link control LLC"><note>The LLC, defined in the IEEE 802.2 specification, communicates with the protocol immediately above it, the network layer.

TCP is a reliable and connection-oriented protocol.
It also supports packet sequencing (to ensure each and every packet was received), flow and congestion control, and error detection and correction.

This means the two hosts must agree on certain parameters, data flow, windowing, error detection, and options.

The TCP three-way handshake:
1. SYN
2. SYN/ACK
3. ACK
The connection that has been set up at this point is considered full duplex

Attacks:
SYN flood - attacker sends SYN packets with a spoofed address, then the victim system replies to the spoofed address with SYN/ACK packets. Each time the victim system receives one of these SYN packets it sets aside resources to manage the new connection. If the attacker floods the victim system with SYN packets, eventually the victim system allocates all of its available TCP connection resources and can no longer process new requests. This is a type of DoS.

To thwart this type of attack you can use SYN proxies, which limit the number of open and abandoned network connections.

TCP session hijacking
the attacker has to spoof the sender’s address and use the correct sequence number values. If an attacker can correctly predict the TCP sequence numbers that two systems will use, then he can create packets containing those numbers and fool the receiving system into thinking that the packets are coming from the authorized sending system.</note></topic><topic id="19" parent="13" x="735.43" y="231.02" text="IP Addressing"><note>Class A - 0.0.0.0 -&gt; 127.255.255.255

IP provides addressing, packet fragmentation, and packet timeouts. To ensure that packets do not continually traverse a network forever, IP provides a Time to Live (TTL) value that is decremented every time the packet passes through a router. IP can also provide a Type of Service (ToS) capability, which means it can prioritize different packets for time-sensitive functions.</note></topic><topic id="20" parent="13" x="857.54" y="210.24" text="IPv6"><note>The IPv6 specification is outlined in RFC 2460

The 6to4 and Teredo are intersite tunneling mechanisms, and ISATAP is an intrasite mechanism.

6to4
In the 6to4 tunneling method the tunnel endpoints are determined by using a well-known IPv4 anycast address on the remote side and embeds IPv4 address data within IPv6 addresses on the local side. 


Teredo 
is another automatic tunneling technique that uses UDP encapsulation so that NAT address translations are not affected. 


Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISA-TAP) 
treats the IPv4 network as a virtual IPv6 local link, with mappings from each IPv4 address to a link-local IPv6 address.</note></topic><topic id="22" parent="2" x="964.32" y="245.28" text="Layer 2 Security\NStandards"></topic><topic id="23" parent="22" x="992.17" y="190.89" text="802.1X EAP-TLS\Nframework"><note>When a new device is installed on the network, it cannot just start communicating with other devices, receive an IP address from a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server, resolve names with the Domain Name Service (DNS) server, etc. The device cannot carry out any network activity until it is authorized to do so. So 802.1X port authentication kicks in, which means that only authentication data are allowed to travel from the new device to the authenticating server. The authentication data is the digital certificate and hardware identity associated with that device (802.1AR), which is processed by EAP-TLS. Once the device is authenticated, usually by a Remote Authentication Dial-In User Server (RADIUS) server, encryption keying material is negotiated and agreed upon between surrounding network devices.

Compared to twisted-pair cable, coaxial cable is more resistant to electromagnetic interference (EMI), provides a higher bandwidth, and supports the use of longer cable lengths, but Twisted-pair cable is cheaper and easier to work with.
 
Coaxial cabling is used as a transmission line for radio frequency signals. If you have cable TV, you have coaxial cabling entering your house and the back of your TV. The various TV channels are carried over different radio frequencies. This technology allows to use some of the “empty” TV frequencies for Internet connectivity.</note></topic><topic id="34" parent="32" x="132.62" y="167.04" text="Twisted pair"><note>Twisted-pair cabling has insulated copper wires surrounded by an outer protective jacket.


Shielded twisted pair (STP):
the cable has an outer foil shielding. This adds protection from radio frequency interference and electromagnetic interference.

Unshielded twisted pair (UTP):
Twisted-pair cabling, which does not have this extra outer shielding

Twisting of the wires protects the integrity and strength of the signals they carry. Each wire forms a balanced circuit, because the voltage in each pair uses the same amplitude, just with opposite phases. The tighter the twisting of the wires, the more resistant the cable is to interference and attenuation.</note></topic><topic id="35" parent="34" x="73.25" y="121.68" text="Cable ratings"><note>Category 1:

Fiber cabling is not as affected by attenuation and EMI when compared to cabling that uses copper. It does not radiate signals, as does UTP cabling, and is difficult to eavesdrop on; therefore, fiber-optic cabling is much more secure than UTP, STP, or coaxial.

Fiber-optic cable is expensive and difficult to work with. It is usually used in backbone networks and environments that require high data transfer rates.</note></topic><topic id="37" parent="36" x="265.21" y="23.68" text="Modes"><note>Single mode

This background noise can combine with the data being transmitted over the cable and distort the signal. The more noise there is interacting with the cable, the more likely the receiving end will not receive the data in the form originally transmitted.</note></topic><topic id="40" parent="38" x="404.56" y="223.95" text="Attenuation"><note>Attenuation is the loss of signal strength as it travels. 
The longer a cable, the more attenuation occurs, which causes the signal carrying the data to deteriorate. This is why standards include suggested cable-run lengths.

The effects of attenuation increase with higher frequencies; thus, 100Base-TX at 80MHz has a higher attenuation rate than 10Base-T at 10MHz. 

If a network administrator needs to run a cable longer than its recommended segment length, he needs to insert a repeater or some type of device that will amplify the signal and ensure it gets to its destination in the right encoding format.
Attenuation can also be caused by cable breaks and malfunctions. This is why cables should be tested. If a cable is suspected of attenuation problems, cable testers can inject signals into the cable and read the results at the end of the cable.</note></topic><topic id="41" parent="38" x="356.71" y="272.89" text="Crosstalk"><note>Crosstalk is a phenomenon that occurs when electrical signals of one wire spill over to the signals of another wire. When the different electrical signals mix, their integrity degrades and data corruption can occur. UTP is much more vulnerable to crosstalk than STP or coaxial because it does not have extra layers of shielding to help protect against it.

The two-wire pairs within twisted-pair cables form a balanced circuit because they both have the same amplitude, just with different phases. Crosstalk and background noise can throw off this balance, and the wire can actually start to act like an antenna, which means it will be more susceptible to picking up other noises in the environment.</note></topic><topic id="42" parent="32" x="196.93" y="239.00" text="Fire rating"><note>Some cables produce hazardous gases when on fire that would spread throughout the building quickly. Network cabling that is placed in these types of areas, called plenum space, must meet a specific fire rating to ensure it will not produce and release harmful chemicals in case of a fire. A ventilation system’s components are usually located in this plenum space, so if toxic chemicals were to get into that area, they could easily spread throughout the building in minutes.

Nonplenum cables usually have a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) jacket covering, whereas plenum-rated cables have jacket covers made of fluoropolymers. 

Cables should be installed in unexposed areas so they are not easily tripped over, damaged, or eavesdropped upon. The cables should be strung behind walls and in the protected spaces as in dropped ceilings. In environments that require extensive security, wires are encapsulated within pressurized conduits so if someone attempts to access a wire, the pressure of the conduit will change, causing an alarm to sound and a message to be sent to the security staff.</note></topic><topic id="43" parent="32" x="297.32" y="133.11" text="Standards"><note>The standards are developed and maintained by the Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) and the Electronic Industries Association (EIA).

Ring topologies are considered deterministic, meaning that the rate of the traffic flow can be predicted. This can be beneficial for time-sensitive applications.


FDDI has a data transmission speed of up to 100 Mbps and is usually used as a backbone network using fiber-optic cabling. FDDI also provides fault tolerance by offering a second counter-rotating fiber ring. The primary ring has data traveling clockwise and is used for regular data transmission. The second ring transmits data in a counterclockwise fashion and is invoked only if the primary ring goes down. Sensors watch the primary ring and, if it goes down, invoke a ring wrap so the data will be diverted to the second ring.

The token is passed from computer to computer, and only the computer that has the token can actually put frames onto the wire. 

The token contains the data to be transmitted and source and destination address information. 

Each computer checks this message to determine whether it is addressed to it, which continues until the destination computer receives the message. The destination computer makes a copy of the message and flips a bit to tell the source computer it did indeed get its message. Once this gets back to the source computer, it removes the frames from the network. The destination computer makes a copy of the message, but only the originator of the message can remove the message from the token and the network.
If a computer that receives the token does not have a message to transmit, it sends the token to the next computer on the network. An empty token has a header, data field, and trailer, but a token that has an actual message has a new header, destination address, source address, and a new trailer.</note></topic><topic id="55" parent="53" x="-359.44" y="189.36" text="CSMA"><note>A transmission is called a carrier, so if a computer is transmitting frames, it is performing a carrier activity.

When using the CSMA/CD access method, computers listen for the absence of a carrier tone on the cable, which indicates that no other system is transmitting data.

A collision happens when two or more frames collide, which most likely corrupts both frames. If a computer puts frames on the wire and its frames collide with another computer’s frames, it will abort its transmission and alert all other stations that a collision just took place. All stations will execute a random collision timer to force a delay before they attempt to transmit data. This random collision timer is called the back-off algorithm.

Collisions are usually reduced by dividing a network with routers or switches.</note></topic><topic id="57" parent="55" x="-417.83" y="209.76" text="CA"><note>Wi-Fi uses CSMA\CA

Carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA)

each computer signals its intent to transmit data before it actually does so. This tells all other computers on the network not to transmit data right now because doing so could cause a collision. 
Each system will wait a period of time before attempting to transmit data to ensure collisions do not take place.

If the same subnet is divided by bridges, the bridges can enable the broadcast traffic to pass between the different parts of a subnet, but not the collisions. This is how collision domains are formed. Isolating collision domains reduces the amount of collisions that take place on a network and increases its overall performance.

Another benefit of restricting and controlling broadcast and collision domains is that it makes sniffing the network and obtaining useful information more difficult for an intruder as he traverses the network.</note></topic><topic id="59" parent="53" x="-235.64" y="200.90" text="Polling"><note>mainframe media access technology uses polling

How does a server multicast to one particular computer on a specific network and no other networks in between?

The user who elects to receive a multicast actually has to tell his local router he wants to get frames with this particular multicast address passed his way.

This happens through the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP). When the data link layer receives a frame, the network layer has already attached the destination IP address to it, but the data link layer cannot understand the IP address and thus invokes ARP for help. ARP broadcasts a frame requesting the MAC address that corresponds with the destination IP address. Each computer on the subnet receives this broadcast frame, and all but the computer that has the requested IP address ignore it. The computer that has the destination IP address responds with its MAC address. Now ARP knows what hardware address corresponds with that specific IP address. The data link layer takes the frame, adds the hardware address to it, and passes it on to the physical layer, which enables the frame to hit the wire and go to the destination computer. ARP maps the hardware address and associated IP address and stores this mapping in its table for a predefined amount of time. This caching is done so that when another frame destined for the same IP address needs to hit the wire, ARP does not need to broadcast its request again. It just looks in its table for this information.</note></topic><topic id="65" parent="64" x="-702.72" y="414.75" text="ARP table\Ncache\Npoisoning"><note>If the attacker modifies the MAC tables in Bob’s and Alice’s systems and maps his MAC address to their IP addresses, all traffic can be sent to his system without Bob and Alice being aware of it.

Diskless workstations do not have a full operating system but have just enough code to know how to boot up and broadcast for an IP address, and they may have a pointer to the server that holds the operating system.

The most commonly understood use of ICMP is through the use of the ping utility. When a person wants to test connectivity to another system, he may ping it, which sends out ICMP ECHO REQUEST frames. The replies on his screen that are returned to the ping utility are called ICMP ECHO REPLY frames and are responding to the ECHO REQUEST frames. If a reply is not returned within a predefined time period, the ping utility sends more ECHO REQUEST frames. If there is still no reply, ping indicates the host is unreachable.
ICMP also indicates when problems occur with a specific route on the network and tells surrounding routers about better routes to take based on the health and congestion of the various pathways. Routers use ICMP to send messages in response to packets that could not be delivered. The router selects the proper ICMP response and sends it back to the requesting host, indicating that problems were encountered with the transmission request.
ICMP is used by other connectionless protocols, not just IP, because connectionless protocols do not have any way of detecting and reacting to transmission errors, as do connection-oriented protocols. In these instances, the connectionless protocol may use ICMP to send error messages back to the sending system to indicate networking problems.</note></topic><topic id="71" parent="70" x="-386.66" y="558.61" text="Ping of Death"><note>The Ping of Death attack is based upon the use of oversized ICMP packets.

The NAT device changes the IP address in the computer’s packet header to 127.50.41.3, with the source port 40,000. When computer B also needs to communicate with a system on the Internet, the NAT device documents the private address and source port number (10.10.44.15; port 23,398) and changes the header information to 127.50.41.3 with source port 40,001.

A bridge is used to divide overburdened networks into smaller segments to ensure better use of bandwidth and traffic control. A bridge amplifies the electrical signal, as does a repeater, but it has more intelligence than a repeater and is used to extend a LAN and enable the administrator to filter frames so he can control which frames go where.

It does this by examining frames and making entries in its forwarding table.

If the bridge receives a request to send a frame to a destination that is not in its forwarding table, it sends out a query frame on each network segment except for the source segment. The destination host is the only one that replies to this query. The bridge updates its table with this computer address and the port to which it is connected, and forwards the frame.</note></topic><topic id="120" parent="118" x="-357.99" y="1220.97" text="static paths"></topic><topic id="121" parent="118" x="-234.01" y="1249.41" text="STA"><note>Spanning Tree Algorithm (STA)

When a frame comes to a hub, the hub sends the frame out through all of its ports. When a frame comes to a bridge, the bridge sends the frame to the port to which the destination network segment is connected. When a frame comes to a switch, the switch sends the frame directly to the destination computer or network, which results in a reduction of traffic.

When switches are used, contention and collisions are not issues, which results in more efficient use of the network’s bandwidth and decreased latency.</note></topic><topic id="125" parent="124" x="-90.20" y="1235.93" text="L2"><note>Basic switches work at the data link layer and forward traffic based on MAC addresses</note></topic><topic id="126" parent="124" x="-40.37" y="1242.62" text="L3&amp;L4"><note>These switches are referred to as multilayered switches because they combine data link layer, network layer, and other layer functionalities.

All the switches in between this first switch and the destination host just review this tag information to determine which route it needs to take, instead of analyzing the full header. Once the packet reaches the last switch, this tag is removed and the packet is sent to the destination. This process increases the speed of routing of packets from one location to another.

A router splits up a network into collision domains and broadcast domains. A router gives more of a clear-cut division between network segments than repeaters or bridges. A router should be used if an administrator wants to have more defined control of where the traffic goes, because more sophisticated filtering is available with routers, and when a router is used to segment a network, the result is more controllable sections.

- Creates a new header for each packet
- Builds routing tables based on IP addresses
- Assigns a different network address per port
- Filters traffic based on IP addresses
- Does not forward broadcast packets
- Forwards traffic if a destination address is unknown to the bridge

A router discovers information about routes and changes that take place in a network through its routing protocols (RIP, BGP, OSPF, and others). These protocols tell routers if a link has gone down, if a route is congested, and if another route is more economical. They also update routing tables and indicate if a router is having problems or has gone down.</note></topic><topic id="131" parent="110" x="5.11" y="1180.74" text="Gateway"><note>Gateway is a general term for software running on a device that connects two different environments</note></topic><topic id="132" parent="110" x="33.73" y="1141.73" text="PBX"><note>A Private Branch Exchange (PBX) is a private telephone switch that is located on a company’s property.

When the destination system sends a response, the firewall allows it. These ACLs are dynamic in nature, so once the connection is finished (either a FIN or RST packet is received), the ACL is removed from the list.

Packet filtering is a firewall technology that makes access decisions based upon network-level protocol header values. The device that is carrying out packet filtering processes is configured with ACLs, which dictate the type of traffic that is allowed into and out of specific networks.

The filters only have the capability of reviewing protocol header information at the network and transport levels.

This means the filters can make access decisions based upon the following basic criteria:
- Source and destination IP addresses
- Source and destination port numbers

The difference is that a permanent path is set up for PVC frames, whereas when SVCs are used, a circuit must be built. It is similar to setting up a phone call over the public network. During the setup procedure, the required bandwidth is requested, the destination computer is contacted and must accept the call, a path is determined, and forwarding information is programmed into each switch along the SVC’s path. 

SVCs are used for teleconferencing, establishing temporary connections to remote sites, data replication, and voice calls. Once the connection is no longer needed, the circuit is torn down and the switches forget it ever existed.

High-level Data Link Control (HDLC) is a protocol that is also a bit-oriented link layer protocol and is used for serial device-to-device WAN communication. 
HDLC is an extension of SDLC, which was mainly used in SNA environments. SDLC basically died out as the mainframe environments using SNA reduced greatly in numbers. HDLC stayed around and evolved.

Telecommunication devices commonly use PPP as their data link protocol.
PPP carries out several functions :

three-way-handshake: 

1. System A starts by sending an INVITE packet to system B. Since Bill’s system is unaware of John’s location, the INVITE packet is sent to the SIP server, which looks up John’s address in the SIP registrar server. Once the location of John’s system has been determined, the INVITE packet is forwarded to him. During this entire process, the server keeps the caller (Bill) updated by sending him a TRYING packet, indicating the process is underway. Once the INVITE packet reaches John’s system, it starts ringing. While John’s system rings and waits for John to respond, it sends a RINGING packet to Bill’s system, notifying Bill that the INVITE packet has been received and John’s system is waiting for John to accept the call. As soon as John answers the call, an OK packet is sent to Bill’s system (through the server).

. It is important to note here that SIP itself is not used to stream the conversation because it’s just a signaling protocol. The actual voice stream is carried on media protocols such as the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP). RTP provides a standardized packet format for delivering audio and video over IP networks. Once Bill and John are done communicating, a BYE message is sent from the system terminating the call. The other system responds with an OK, acknowledging the session has ended.

The IP telephony device 
is just a phone that has the necessary software that allows it to work as a network device. 
In VoIP, the phone must be “smart” by having the necessary software to take analog signals, digitize them, break them into packets, and create the necessary headers and trailers for the packets to find their destination. 

The voicemail system 
is a storage place for messages and provides user directory lookups and call-forwarding functionality. 

A voice gateway carries out packet routing and provides access to legacy voice systems and backup calling processes.

1. Phone will send a message to the call-processing manager to indicate a call needs to be set up. 
2. When the person at the destination takes her phone off the hook, this notifies the call-processing manager that the call has been accepted. 
3. The call-processing manager notifies both the sending and receiving phones that the channel is active, and voice data are sent back and forth over a traditional data network line.</note></topic><topic id="220" parent="219" x="720.09" y="1531.35" text="Servers"><note>The SIP architecture consists of three different types of servers, which play an integral role in the entire communication process of the VoIP system. 

1. proxy server
is used to relay packets within a network between the UACs and the UAS. It also forwards requests generated by callers to their respective recipients. Proxy servers are also generally used for name mapping, which allows the proxy server to interlink an external SIP system to an internal SIP client.

2. registrar server
keeps a centralized record of the updated locations of all the users on the network. These addresses are stored on a location server. 

3. redirect server 
The redirect server allows SIP devices to retain their SIP identities despite changes in their geographic location. This allows a device to remain accessible when its location is physically changed and hence while it moves through different networks. The use of redirect servers allows clients to remain within reach while they move through numerous network coverage zones. This configuration is generally known as an intraorganizational configuration. Intraorganizational routing enables SIP traffic to be routed within a VoIP network without being transmitted over the PSTN or external network.</note></topic><topic id="221" parent="215" x="722.45" y="1419.81" text="Streaming"><note>RTP is a session layer protocol that carries data in media stream format, as in audio and video, and is used extensively in VoIP, telephony, video conferencing, and other multimedia streaming technologies.

Countermeasures:

1. Keep patches updated on each network device involved with VoIP transmissions:

- The gateway server.

2. Identify unidentified or rogue telephony devices:
- Implement authentication so only authorized telephony devices are working on the network.
- Install and maintain:
--Stateful firewalls.
--VPN for sensitive voice data.
--Intrusion detection.

3. Disable unnecessary ports and services on routers, switches, PCs, and IP telephones.

4. Employ real-time monitoring that looks for attacks, tunneling, and abusive call patterns through IDS/IPS.

5. Employ content monitoring.
- Use encryption when data (voice, fax, video) cross an untrusted network.
- Use a two-factor authentication technology.
- Limit the number of calls via media gateways.
- Close the media sessions after completion.</note></topic><topic id="223" parent="0" x="1192.80" y="829.86" text="Remote Connectivity"></topic><topic id="224" parent="223" x="1199.81" y="888.73" text="Dial-up"><note>Like most telecommunication connections, dial-up connections take place over PPP, which has authentication capabilities.

TKIP was developed by the IEEE 802.11i task group and the Wi-Fi Alliance. The goal of this protocol was to increase the strength of WEP or replace it fully without the need for hardware replacement.

TKIP addresses the deficiencies of WEP pertaining to static WEP keys and inadequate use of IV values.
TKIP actually works with WEP by feeding it keying material, which is data to be used for generating new dynamic keys. The new standard also integrated 802.1X port authentication and EAP authentication methods.

TKIP also deals with the integrity issues by using a MIC instead of an ICV function.</note></topic><topic id="261" parent="259" x="1770.28" y="991.14" text="CCMP"><note>encryption protection with the use of the AES algorithm in counter mode with CBC-MAC (CCM), which is referred to as the CCM Protocol (CCMP).

An AP can cover only a certain distance, and as the user moves out of the range of the first AP, another AP needs to pick up and maintain her signal to ensure she does not lose network connectivity. This is referred to as roaming, and for this to happen seamlessly, the APs need to communicate with each other. If the second AP must take over this user’s communication, it will need to be assured that this user has been properly authenticated and must know the necessary settings for this user’s connection. This means the first AP would need to be able to convey this information to the second AP. The conveying of this information between the different APs during roaming is what 802.11f deals with. It outlines how these data can be properly shared.</note></topic><topic id="268" parent="267" x="2120.74" y="650.60" text="Roaming"></topic><topic id="269" parent="262" x="2055.73" y="616.24" text="802.11g"><note>The 802.11g standard provides for higher data transfer rates—up to 54 Mbps.

was the earliest multiple access technology put into practice. 
The available frequency range is divided into sub-bands (channels), and one channel is assigned to each subscriber (cell phone). 
The subscriber has exclusive use of that channel while the call is made, or until the call is terminated or handed off; no other calls or conversations can be made on that channel during that call.

increases the speed and efficiency by taking the radio-frequency spectrum channels and dividing them into time slots. 
At various time periods, multiple users can share the same channel; the systems within the cell swap from one user to another user, in effect, reusing the available frequencies. 
Time is divided into frames. Each frame is divided into slots. TDMA requires that each slot’s start and end time are known to both the source and the destination. 
Mobile communication systems such as Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM), Digital AMPS (D-AMPS), and Personal Digital Cellular (PDC) use TDMA.</note></topic><topic id="284" parent="283" x="1590.59" y="1014.15" text="2G"><note>Primarily voice, some low-speed data (circuit switched)

CDMA assigns a unique code to each voice call or data transmission to uniquely identify it from all other transmissions sent over the cellular network. In a CDMA “spread spectrum” network, calls are spread throughout the entire radio-frequency band. CDMA permits every user of the network to simultaneously use every channel in the network. At the same time, a particular cell can simultaneously interact with multiple other cells. These features make CDMA a very powerful technology. It is the main technology for the mobile cellular networks that presently dominate the wireless space.</note></topic><topic id="286" parent="285" x="1646.16" y="1014.55" text="3G"><note>Integration of voice and data

In OFDMA, each of the channels is subdivided into a set of closely spaced orthogonal frequencies with narrow bandwidths (subchannels). Each of the different subchannels can be transmitted and received simultaneously in a multiple input and output (MIMO) manner. The use of orthogonal frequencies and MIMO allows signal processing techniques to reduce the impacts of any interference between different subchannels and to correct for channel impairments, such as noise and selective frequency fading. 4G requires that OFDMA be used.</note></topic><topic id="288" parent="287" x="1702.22" y="1014.10" text="4G"><note>Based on an all-IP packet-switched network
